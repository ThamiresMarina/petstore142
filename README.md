# PetStore API Testing Project

This project is designed to automate API testing for a PetStore application using Java, RestAssured, and JUnit. The goal is to ensure the stability and correctness of the PetStore API endpoints through various test cases, including the creation, update, and retrieval of pet data.

### Technologies Used:
- **Java 23**
- **JUnit**
- **RestAssured** for API testing
- **Maven** for project management and dependencies

### Key Features:
- Automated tests for basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Test data validation (JSON format)
- REST API interaction using HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Clear and detailed logs of requests and responses

### How to Run:
1. Clone the repository:  
   `git clone https://github.com/ThamiresMarina/petstore-api-testing.git`

2. Navigate to the project directory:  
   `cd petstore-api-testing`

3. Run the tests with Maven:  
   `mvn test`

### Purpose:
This project showcases my ability to automate API tests and ensures I am equipped to handle real-world testing challenges using industry-standard tools. I am continuously expanding this project to include more advanced features and use cases.
